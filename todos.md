Is mlups calculation correct?: consequently bandwidth calculation

communicator comparison hpc: As well as socket binding strategy: Include table or some sort of breakdown of ranks: Maybe barplot of rank placement of sockets: intra vs inter node communication Maybe we need to upload artifact table containing pr ranks breakdown: hostname, socket id, cpu type/model and halo communication timings. Along with some sort of neighbor mapping: Then we could use networkx or something for a rank distribution visulization 

Scaling plots, bandwidth/mlups plot

Report: Bibliography: Multigrid briggs or trottenberg



Surface to volume scaling plot: Maybe just use experiment data: Halo size and local volume

Check assignment description and notes (general feedback) from last project + feedback 

Socket host and so breakdown of ranks need to happen within the solver

Doublecheck: are timings meaningful? Is wall time calculayed correctly?

Report: Note on the fact that we never gather global solution

Report: Note on implementation complexity of custom va numpy

Make a proper plan of final sprint: first of all ensure code is ready for hpc runs: Then postprocessing/plotting comes after

Clean up git repo: Traces or AI

mlflow run tagging: if its a local or hpc run

explicitly set numba threads in solver init using os.environment variable
