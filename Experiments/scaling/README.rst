Scaling Analysis
================

Comprehensive parallel scaling analysis for MPI implementations. Strong scaling experiments use fixed problem size with increasing ranks to measure parallel speedup (ideally Time ∝ 1/ranks). Weak scaling experiments maintain constant work per rank while growing both problem size and rank count proportionally to measure parallel efficiency (ideally constant time). These experiments identify communication vs computation bottlenecks and determine optimal configurations.
