Kernel Benchmarks
=================

Compare Numba JIT-compiled kernels vs pure NumPy implementations.

Investigation Goals
-------------------

1. **Numba vs Numpy Performance**: Measure speedup from JIT compilation
2. **Thread Scaling**: Test performance with different thread counts
3. **Problem Size Scaling**: How does each kernel scale with N?
