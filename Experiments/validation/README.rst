Solver Validation
=================

Validation experiments verifying solver correctness and convergence properties. These experiments establish that the implementations produce accurate solutions to the Poisson equation with known analytical solutions. Includes spatial convergence analysis (error vs problem size) and iterative convergence verification (residual vs iteration count).
